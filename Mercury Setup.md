Mercury Setup
=============

Just download the Mercury setup compiled with VS2013. It will install into the C drive. You can't really change the location.

These don't seem to work:

```
export PATH="$PATH:/cygdrive/c/mercury-14.01-vs2013/bin"
export PATH="$PATH:/cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0/VC/bin"
```
